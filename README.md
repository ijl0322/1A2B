# 1A2B
1A2B is an implementation of the classic 1A2B game! 

This program generates four random numbers and prompts the user to guess these numbers. 
If a number the user guesses is in the program generated numbers, and is in the right position, 
the program returns 1A; If a number the user guesses is in the program generated numbers, 
and but is not in the right position, the program returns 1B. 
After each guess, the program will let the user know how many A and B's the user get for that guess. 
The user wins if he/she guesses the number correctly in 10 turns.
